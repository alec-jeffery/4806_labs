# 4806_labs

This repository was created to test out CircleCI and Heroku builds for a lab in one of my fourth year courses. The code was done in Java Spring to open a simple webpage to create a buddy with a name and address. This buddy can then get added to the Addressbook where you can see multiple Buddys.
